	<h2>What is Refugee Learning Accelerator?</h2>
	<p class="QA">The Refugee Learning Accelerator is a six month accelerator program. We support engineers and computer scientists from the Middle East to create technology for refugee learners through training, mentorship and funding.</p>	     
	<h2>Who is eligible to participate in the Refugee Learning Accelerator?</h2>
	<p class="QA">You must apply to the Refugee Learning Accelerator in a team. Teams will be composed of 3-6 individuals with backgrounds in engineering, computer science, design etc. All participants must be from Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon or Palestine. By “from” we mean either that you are a citizen or resident of one of these places. We understand that these categories are complicated--if you aren’t sure whether or not you are eligible, please email us at <a href=”mailto:refugees@media.mit.edu”>refugees@media.mit.edu</a>. We will give priority to teams where the majority of participants live in the Middle East. </p>
	<h2>What do participants in the Refugee Learning Accelerator program receive?</h2>
	<p>The Refugee Learning Accelerator is a three stage program and your team must be selected to advance through each of the stages. All admitted teams will have the opportunity to participate in the Ideate phase, which is six week online course structures around series of design challenges. In this stage, your team will have access to mentors with expertise in relevant technologies, digital pedagogy and refugee education.</p> 
	<p>Teams will be selected to advance to the Prototype phase on the basis of their performance and participation. The Prototype phase will be an in-person workshop in Amman, Jordan. The Accelerator will cover the cost of travel. In this phase, your team will prototype a project and pitch it to a panel of judges. You will have access to expert feedback and mentorship. </p>
	<p class="QA">The most promising projects will be selected to advance to the Incubate phase. In this phase, teams will have access to funding, technical advice, support setting up partnerships and mentorship on topics like entrepreneurship and monitoring & evaluations. </p>	     
	<h2>There are lots of other incubators and accelerators. What need does this program fill?</h2>
	<p class="QA">We’re super excited about all the innovation happening around digital education for refugees, but we think that not enough is being done to build capacity in the countries most affected by the Syrian refugee crisis. We’re also thrilled by all the energy in the tech community around responding the refugee crisis, but acknowledge that hackathons have their limitations--particularly in terms of their short duration and a lack of available funding. We designed the Accelerator to respond to these twin trends. </p>
	<h2>I already have an idea about using technology to support refugee learners, can I still apply?</h2>
	<p class="QA"Certainly, but you’ll still have to go through the <a class=”class2” href=”/program”>Ideate stage.</a> We have expertise with what works and what has already been done, when it comes to technology and refugee learners, and we want you to acquire that knowledge as well. </p>		    
	<h2> What is the time commitment?</h2>      
	<p class="QA">The time commitment will vary by phase: in the Ideate phase we will expect you to spend about 15-20 hours per week working on projects for the Refugee Learning Accelerator; in the Prototype phase teams will spend a week together in Amman, working full-time. The Accelerator is designed to be part-time commitment. We do not expect you to quit your job or suspend your schooling to work on this project.</p>	     
	<h2>Can I apply as an individual?</h2>
	<p class="QA">No. We’re looking for people to apply on teams. However, if you don’t already have a team you can head over to our <a href=”https://www.facebook.com/groups/147496302487491” class=”class2”>Facebook Marketplace</a> to find other individuals interested in forming a team.</p>				    
	<h2>I’m a Syrian refugee and no longer live in the Middle East, can I still apply?</h2>
	<p>Definitely! Syrian refugees are eligible to apply from wherever they are currently living. </p>
	<p class="QA"> Unfortunately, due to restrictions on our funding, we are unable to work with current residents of Syria. </p>
	<h2>I’m Lebanese/Jordanian/Iraqi/Palestinian, but live in X, can I still apply?</h2>
	<p class="QA">Definitely! However, in the application we will ask about your future plans and commitment to the region. We’re looking to support projects that will be based in the Middle East, not another refugee project based in Cambridge, Massachusetts (not that there is anything wrong with this town!).</p>			  
	<h2>Does my team all have to be located in one place?</h2>
<p class="QA">No. It will probably be easier to work together if at least a portion of your team is co-located, but it is not a requirement.</p>
	 
	<h2>If my team is accepted into the <a class=”class2” href=”/program”>Prototype phase</a>, do we have to cover the cost of travel to Amman?</h2>
	<p class="QA">No. The Refugee Learning Accelerator will cover the cost of travel for all successful teams. However, it is your responsibility to make sure that you have a valid passport.</p>
	<h2>Does our idea have to be for-profit?</h2>
	<p class="QA">No, definitely not! It’s hard to make money off of education, and even harder to do it ethically. While it would be great if teams came up with financially self-sustaining ideas, we recognize that this might not be realistic. We’re committed to providing you with the initial funding and then, as the project develops, helping you find other sources of funding--this could come from investors, but it could also be from governments or philanthropic foundations.</p>
	<h2>Do you provide office space?</h2>
	<p class="QA">No. However, in the Incubate stage teams are welcome to use a portion of their funding to secure office space.</p>
	<h2>In the <a href=”/program” class=”class2”>Incubate phase</a>, what terms are attached to the funding?</h2>
	<p class="QA">We do not take equity and programs can exit the accelerator with no further commitments to MIT or the Refugee Learning Accelerator.</p>
	<h2>What is the Refugee Learning Accelerator’s relationship to the MIT Media Lab?</h2>
	<p class="QA">The Refugee Learning Accelerator is a project of the Learning Initiative which is a part of the MIT Media Lab.</p>
	<h2>Will participants travel to MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts?</h2>
	<p class="QA">No. Successful participants will be brought together in Beirut or Amman. There will be no travel to the U.S.</p>
	<h2>Upon completion of the program, will I receive a degree from MIT?</h2>
	<p class="QA">No. This is not an accredited education program.</p>
	<h2>Does MIT own the intellectual property of Refugee Learning Accelerator projects?</h2>
	<p class="QA">...</p>
	<h2>What’s the ultimate aim of the Refugee Learning Accelerator?</h2>
	<p class="QA">This is a pilot phase and--to a certain extent--an experiment. We believe that the Middle East is facing a series of crisis around refugees, youth employment, and education, but that it already has many of the tools necessary to respond to these crises. We’re passionate about supporting young computer scientists and engineers to think critically about the future of learning.</p>
	<h2>How can I get involved in the program?</h2>
		     <p>If you’re a computer scientist, engineer or designer from Syria, Palestine, Iraq, Jordan or Lebanon: </p>
<p style="text-indent: 20px">
1. Put together a team <br>
2. Fill out the form on the Apply page with your contact details<br>
3. We’ll email you when applications open in mid-August </p>
			    <p class="QA">If you don’t fit that criteria, but are still interested in supporting the project, email us at <a href=”mailto:refugees@media.mit.edu” class=”class2”>refugees@media.mit.edu</a></p>
