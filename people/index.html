  <h1>Who We Are</h1>
 
<p>The Learning Initiative is part of the MIT Media Lab, an anti-disciplinary research lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that designs technologies for people to create a better future. The Learning Initiative is focused on the future of learning, which we believe should be playful, project-based, peer-focused and passion-fuelled.  </p>
