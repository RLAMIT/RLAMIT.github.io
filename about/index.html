  <p>We support technologists in the Middle East in responding to challenges faced by refugee learners.
The Refugee Learning Accelerator provides training, mentorship, and funding to young designers and developers from the Middle East so they can imagine, design, and prototype technology-based solutions to the problems faced by refugee learners, aged 14-24.
Target participants
University students and recent graduates with backgrounds in computer science, design, and electrical engineering,
coming from some of the places most impacted by the current refugee crisis: Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Palestine.
