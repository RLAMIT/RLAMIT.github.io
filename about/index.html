<div class="blurb"> 
<p>The Refugee Learning Accelerator is a project of the MIT Media Labâ€™s Learning Initiative. We support engineers and computer scientists from the Middle East to create technology for refugee learners through training, mentorship and funding.</p>
  <p>The Learning Initiative is part of the MIT Media Lab[hyperlink], an anti-disciplinary research lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that designs technologies for people to create a better future. The Learning Initiative[hyperlink] is focused on the future of learning, which we believe should be playful, project-based, peer-focused and passion-fuelled. </p>
